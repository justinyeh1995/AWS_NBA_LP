the following components:

1. Lambda functions for data fetching:

- Create one or more Lambda functions responsible for fetching data from the NBA API and updating your database.
- These functions will be triggered periodically by CloudWatch Events to keep your database up to date with the latest data from the NBA API.
- Implement the logic to make HTTP requests to the NBA API, parse the response, and update your database accordingly.

2. Lambda functions for user-facing API:

Create separate Lambda functions to handle user requests and serve the data from your database.
These functions will be triggered by API Gateway when users make requests to your application's endpoints.
Implement the necessary logic to retrieve data from your database based on user requests and return the appropriate responses.

3. API Gateway:

Set up an API in AWS API Gateway to expose your user-facing Lambda functions as RESTful endpoints.
Define the necessary routes, HTTP methods, and request/response mappings for your API.
Configure the integration between API Gateway and your user-facing Lambda functions.

4. RDS (Relational Database Service):

Use Amazon RDS to set up and manage your database instance.
Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) based on your requirements.
Configure the database credentials, security groups, and other settings to ensure secure access from your Lambda functions.

5. CloudWatch Events:

Configure CloudWatch Events to periodically trigger your data fetching Lambda functions.
Define the schedule using cron expressions or rate expressions to determine how often the data should be fetched and updated.

6. Frontend:

6-1. Amplify (optional):

If you have a frontend application that interacts with your serverless backend, you can use AWS Amplify to simplify the deployment and management of your frontend.
Amplify provides features like hosting, authentication, and API integration, making it easier to build and deploy full-stack serverless applications.
